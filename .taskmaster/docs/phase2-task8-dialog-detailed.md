# Phase 2 - Task 8: Dialog Component Migration - Detailed Subtasks

## Overview
Migrate the enhanced Dialog component from the design system to the main application, following TDD principles and ensuring all advanced features are properly implemented.

## Pre-requisites
- Task 7 (Navigation Menu) completed and PR approved
- Understanding of Radix UI Dialog primitive
- Familiarity with animation and accessibility patterns

## Subtasks

### 8.1 Create Feature Branch

- [ ] Test Dialog closes when clicking outside (overlay)

#### 8.2.2 Component Structure Tests
- [ ] Test DialogTrigger renders children correctly
- [ ] Test DialogPortal renders content in portal
- [ ] Test DialogOverlay renders with correct classes
- [ ] Test DialogContent renders with all elements
- [ ] Test DialogHeader structure and styling
- [ ] Test DialogFooter structure and styling
- [ ] Test DialogTitle renders correctly
- [ ] Test DialogDescription renders correctly
- [ ] Test DialogClose button functionality

#### 8.2.3 Accessibility Tests
- [ ] Test proper ARIA attributes on dialog elements
- [ ] Test focus management when dialog opens
- [ ] Test focus returns to trigger when dialog closes
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab)
- [ ] Test screen reader announcements
- [ ] Test role="dialog" is present
- [ ] Test aria-labelledby points to title
- [ ] Test aria-describedby points to description

#### 8.2.4 Animation and State Tests
- [ ] Test data-state attributes change on open/close
- [ ] Test animation classes are applied
- [ ] Test smooth transitions between states
- [ ] Test no animation when prefers-reduced-motion

#### 8.2.5 Advanced Features Tests
- [ ] Test custom className props on all components
- [ ] Test forceMount prop functionality
- [ ] Test controlled vs uncontrolled state
- [ ] Test onOpenChange callback
- [ ] Test nested dialogs behavior
- [ ] Test scroll locking when open

### 8.3 Copy Dialog Component from Design System (TDD - Green Phase)
- [ ] Copy the enhanced Dialog component from `ai_docs/Design_System_for_JIT/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`
- [ ] Ensure all imports are properly updated
- [ ] Verify TypeScript types are correctly defined
- [ ] Check all component exports are included

### 8.4 Fix Failing Tests and Refine Implementation
- [ ] Run tests and identify failures
- [ ] Fix import paths and dependencies
- [ ] Ensure all Radix UI Dialog primitives are properly wrapped
- [ ] Verify animation classes match test expectations
- [ ] Fix any TypeScript errors
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass

### 8.5 Create Dialog Usage Examples
Create example file: `src/components/examples/dialog-examples.tsx`

#### 8.5.1 Basic Examples
- [ ] Simple Dialog with trigger button
- [ ] Dialog with form content
- [ ] Dialog with scrollable content
- [ ] Alert Dialog pattern
- [ ] Confirmation Dialog pattern

#### 8.5.2 Advanced Examples
- [ ] Dialog with custom animations
- [ ] Dialog with dynamic content
- [ ] Dialog with async operations
- [ ] Nested dialogs example
- [ ] Dialog with complex layouts
- [ ] Responsive dialog example

#### 8.5.3 Integration Examples
- [ ] Dialog in navigation context
- [ ] Dialog with other UI components
- [ ] Dialog with dark mode support
- [ ] Dialog with loading states

### 8.6 Verify Dialog Component Styling
- [ ] Test all visual states in light mode
- [ ] Test all visual states in dark mode
- [ ] Verify overlay backdrop blur effect
- [ ] Check responsive behavior on mobile
- [ ] Ensure smooth animations
- [ ] Verify z-index layering
- [ ] Test with long content scrolling

### 8.7 Documentation and Code Quality
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to main Dialog components
- [ ] Document any component-specific props
- [ ] Ensure consistent code style
- [ ] Remove any unused imports
- [ ] Optimize bundle size

### 8.8 Testing and Verification
- [ ] Run `npm test` - all tests pass
- [ ] Run `npm run type-check` - no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run `npm run build` - builds successfully
- [ ] Manual testing in browser
- [ ] Test keyboard accessibility manually
- [ ] Verify no console errors or warnings

### 8.9 Create Pull Request
- [ ] Stage all changes
- [ ] Commit with message: "feat: Implement Dialog component migration (Task #8)"
- [ ] Push branch to remote
- [ ] Create PR to main branch
- [ ] Add PR description with testing checklist
- [ ] Assign PR to raseniero
- [ ] Link to Task #8 in PR description

## Implementation Notes

### Key Differences from Basic Dialog
1. Enhanced animations with data-state attributes
2. Improved focus management
3. Better keyboard navigation
4. Smooth overlay transitions
5. Responsive design considerations
6. Accessibility enhancements

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Forgetting to handle focus trap
2. Not testing keyboard navigation
3. Missing ARIA attributes
4. Incorrect z-index stacking
5. Animation conflicts with reduced motion
6. Not handling scroll locking

### Testing Strategy
- Use `userEvent` for realistic interactions
- Test both mouse and keyboard interactions
- Mock animations for faster tests
- Use accessibility queries (getByRole)
- Test error boundaries for edge cases

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 40+ tests passing
- [ ] Dialog component working identically to design system version
- [ ] Full accessibility compliance
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Examples demonstrate all features
- [ ] PR approved and merged

## Estimated Time: 3-4 hours
- Test writing: 1-1.5 hours
- Implementation: 1 hour
- Examples and verification: 1-1.5 hours
