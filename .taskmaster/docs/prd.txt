# Product Requirements Document: Design System Integration v2

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the integration of a new modern and minimalist design system into the existing JIT.EDU.PH NextJS marketing landing page. The integration will replace the current UI components with a comprehensive design system based on shadcn/ui components, providing a more professional and cohesive user experience for both prospective students and corporate clients.

## Goals

1. **Modernize UI/UX**: Replace existing components with modern, minimalist design system components
2. **Improve User Confidence**: Create a professional interface that instills trust in visitors
3. **Enhance Browsability**: Make it easier for users to find and explore training programs
4. **Maintain Functionality**: Preserve all existing features while upgrading the visual presentation
5. **Ensure Consistency**: Implement a cohesive design language across all pages and components

## User Stories

1. **As a prospective student**, I want to easily browse training programs so that I can find the right course for me.
2. **As a visitor**, I want a modern, professional interface so that I feel confident in the quality of training offered.
3. **As a corporate client**, I want to quickly understand the available programs and their professional quality through the website's appearance.
4. **As a mobile user**, I want the website to be fully responsive and easy to navigate on my device.

   - The system must display all existing course data
   - The system must maintain program selection functionality

10. **Add Program Detail Pages**
    - The system must integrate TrainingProgramLanding component
    - The system must add WebDevelopmentProgram as a specific implementation
    - The system must ensure proper routing between pages

### Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance

11. **Component Testing**
    - The system must have unit tests for all new components
    - The system must ensure all interactive elements are tested
    - The system must validate form submissions work correctly

12. **Integration Testing**
    - The system must test navigation between all pages
    - The system must verify lead capture functionality
    - The system must ensure Supabase integration remains functional

13. **Responsive Testing**
    - The system must work correctly on mobile devices (320px and up)
    - The system must display properly on tablets (768px and up)
    - The system must optimize for desktop screens (1024px and up)

### Phase 5: Final Review & Cleanup

14. **Code Cleanup**
    - The system must remove all unused components
    - The system must ensure consistent import paths
    - The system must remove duplicate styles

15. **Performance Optimization**
    - The system must maintain or improve current page load times
    - The system must optimize images and assets
    - The system must ensure smooth animations and transitions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Database Changes**: This integration will NOT modify any database schemas or structures
2. **API Modifications**: This integration will NOT change any existing API endpoints or server actions
3. **New Features**: This integration will NOT add new functionality beyond UI updates
4. **Authentication Changes**: This integration will NOT modify the existing authentication system
5. **Payment Integration**: This integration will NOT add or modify payment processing

## Design Considerations

- **Design System Location**: All design components are in `ai_docs/Design_System_for_JIT/`
- **Component Library**: Based on shadcn/ui with custom JIT theming
- **Color Scheme**: Primary color #4F46E5 with supporting neutral and semantic colors
- **Typography**: Inter font family with defined scale for headings and body text
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing tokens from xs (4px) to 2xl (48px)
- **Mobile-First**: All components designed with mobile responsiveness as priority

## Technical Considerations

1. **Framework Compatibility**: Must work with Next.js 14 App Router architecture
2. **TypeScript**: All components must have proper TypeScript definitions
3. **Path Aliases**: Use existing path aliases (@/components, @/lib/utils)
4. **Supabase Integration**: Maintain compatibility with existing Supabase client
5. **Server Actions**: Ensure all server actions continue to function
6. **Build Process**: Must pass npm run build without errors
7. **Type Checking**: Must pass npm run type-check without errors

## Success Metrics

1. **Visual Consistency**: 100% of pages use the new design system components
2. **Performance**: Page load time remains under 3 seconds on 3G networks
3. **Accessibility**: Maintains WCAG 2.1 AA compliance score
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: 100% of components work correctly on mobile devices
5. **Build Success**: All builds pass without errors or warnings
6. **Type Safety**: No TypeScript errors in the codebase
7. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage for new components

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement any animation preferences for users who prefer reduced motion?
2. Are there any specific browser compatibility requirements beyond modern browsers?
3. Should we add any analytics tracking for the new UI components?
4. Do we need to maintain any legacy component styles during the transition?
5. Are there any specific performance budgets we should adhere to?
