### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Node.js (for development purposes)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/raseniero/jit-mktg-landing-page.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd jit-mktg-landing-page
```

### Running the Application

There are two ways to run the application:

1. **Using a Local Server (Recommended)**
```bash
# Option 1: Using Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: Using Node.js (if installed)
npx http-server

# Option 3: Using Live Server VS Code extension
# Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server"
```

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
- http://localhost:8000 (for Python server)
- http://localhost:8080 (for Node.js http-server)

2. **Directly Opening the File**
You can also open the landing page directly in your browser:
1. Double-click `index.html` in the project directory
2. Or drag and drop `index.html` into your browser window

Note: For the best experience, we recommend using a local server as it provides proper routing and asset serving.
