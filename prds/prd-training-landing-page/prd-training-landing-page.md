## Feature: Training Program Landing Pages

---

### 1. Introduction/Overview
Create a dedicated landing page for each training program offered. The primary goal is to provide prospective enrollees with detailed information about each course and improve the website's SEO by having unique, indexable pages for each program.

### 2. Goals
- Offer detailed information (title and description) for each training program.
- Improve SEO by enabling search engines to index each course individually.
- Use existing website style and layout for consistency.

### 3. User Stories
- As a prospective student, I want to view a landing page with the title and description of a course so that I can learn what the course is about and decide if I want to enroll.

### 4. Functional Requirements
1. The system must generate a unique landing page for each training program.
2. Each landing page must display the course title.
3. Each landing page must display the course description.

5. Each landing page must be SEO-friendly (unique URL, proper meta tags, etc.).

### 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

### 6. Design Considerations
- Use the same style and layout as the current website for all landing pages.
- All UI components must use shadcn-ui library for consistency and modern UI/UX.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility as per existing standards.

### 7. Technical Considerations

### 8. Success Metrics

### 9. Open Questions
