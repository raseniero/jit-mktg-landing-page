# PRD: Course Detail Page for Training Catalog

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for implementing a "Learn More" button functionality in the training catalog that will direct users to a dedicated course detail page. The goal is to provide users with more information about each course while maintaining a consistent user experience with the existing application.

## 2. Goals
1. Enable users to view detailed information about each training course
2. Maintain consistent styling and layout with the existing application
3. Provide clear navigation back to the course catalog
4. Ensure good performance with lazy loading
5. Handle errors gracefully when courses are not found

## 3. User Stories
1. As a potential student, I want to click "Learn More" on a course card so I can see detailed information about that course.
2. As a user, I want to easily navigate back to the course catalog from the detail page.
3. As a user, I want to see a visually appealing course detail page with relevant information.
4. As a user, I want the page to load quickly, even with images.
5. As a user, I want to see a helpful error message if a course cannot be found.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Page Structure
1. The course detail page must be accessible at `/courses/[course-id]` where `[course-id]` is a unique identifier for each course.
2. The page must include:
   - Course title (from the catalog data)
   - Course icon (from the catalog data)
   - Random course image (from a predefined set of placeholder images)
   - Course description (from the catalog data)
   - Placeholder lorem ipsum text (same for all courses)
   - "Register Now" button (non-functional in this implementation)
   - "Back to Courses" navigation link

### 4.2 Navigation
1. Clicking the "Learn More" button on a course card must navigate to the corresponding course detail page.
2. The "Back to Courses" link must return the user to the main training catalog page.

### 4.3 Layout and Styling
1. The course detail page must maintain the same width and styling as the catalog page.
2. The page must be responsive and work well on all device sizes.
3. The course icon from the catalog must be displayed on the detail page.

### 4.4 Performance
1. Course detail pages must implement lazy loading for images.
2. The page should load within 2 seconds on a 3G connection.

### 4.5 Error Handling
1. If a course with the specified ID does not exist, display a user-friendly error message.
2. Include a link back to the main courses page from the error state.
3. The error page should match the application's design system.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. User authentication or registration functionality
2. Course enrollment or payment processing
3. User reviews or ratings
4. Course progress tracking
5. Social sharing functionality
6. Course search or filtering on the detail page
7. User accounts or profiles

## 6. Design Considerations
1. Use the existing design system and component library.
2. The random course image should be selected from a set of placeholder images related to education and technology.
3. The "Register Now" button should be styled as a primary action button but remain non-functional.
4. The page should maintain the same header and footer as the rest of the application.
5. Include appropriate spacing and typography consistent with the rest of the application.

## 7. Technical Considerations
1. Use Next.js dynamic routing for the course detail pages.
2. Implement static generation for better performance where possible.
3. Use the `next/image` component for optimized image loading.
4. Implement proper error boundaries for the course detail component.
5. Consider implementing ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) if the course data changes frequently.
6. The course data should be fetched from the existing `trainingPrograms` array in `catalog.tsx`.

## 8. Success Metrics
1. 90% of users who view a course detail page view at least one other page in the application.
2. Average time on page for course detail pages is at least 30 seconds.
3. Bounce rate for course detail pages is less than 40%.
4. 95% of page loads complete within 2 seconds on a 3G connection.

## 9. Open Questions
1. Should we track analytics for course detail page views?
2. Do we need to implement any SEO optimizations for these pages?
3. Should we include a breadcrumb navigation component?
4. Should we include a "Related Courses" section in the future?

## 10. Implementation Notes
1. The implementation should follow the existing code style and patterns.
2. Write unit tests for all new components and functionality.
3. Update any relevant documentation.
4. Consider adding integration tests for the course detail page flow.
