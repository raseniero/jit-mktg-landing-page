# PRD: JavaScript Test-Driven Development Documentation Update

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the requirements for updating the existing test-driven development (TDD) documentation to provide JavaScript-specific instructions for AI coding agents. The current documentation is Python-focused and needs to be replaced with JavaScript equivalents using Jest as the testing framework, specifically tailored for Next.js development environments.

The goal is to create a comprehensive, actionable guide that enables AI agents to follow TDD practices when working with JavaScript/TypeScript codebases, ensuring they produce robust, maintainable, and well-tested code.

## Goals

1. **Replace Python-specific content** with JavaScript equivalents throughout the documentation
2. **Implement Jest as the primary testing framework** with Next.js-specific configurations
3. **Update directory structure examples** to reflect JavaScript/Next.js project conventions
4. **Provide clear, actionable instructions** for AI agents to follow TDD methodology in JavaScript
5. **Maintain the same high-quality TDD principles** while adapting them for JavaScript development
6. **Ensure all code examples are functional** and follow JavaScript best practices

## User Stories

- **As an AI Agent Coder**, I want to follow TDD practices in JavaScript so that I can write robust, testable code
- **As an AI Agent Coder**, I want to see JavaScript examples in the TDD guide so that I can apply the concepts to JavaScript/Next.js projects
- **As an AI Agent Coder**, I want to understand Jest testing patterns so that I can write effective unit tests
- **As an AI Agent Coder**, I want to follow JavaScript project structure conventions so that my code integrates seamlessly with existing codebases

## Functional Requirements

1. **Framework Replacement**: Replace all Python `pytest` references with JavaScript `Jest` framework
2. **Language Conversion**: Convert all Python code examples to JavaScript/TypeScript equivalents
3. **Directory Structure**: Update project structure examples to reflect JavaScript/Next.js conventions
4. **Import/Export Syntax**: Replace Python import statements with JavaScript ES6 import/export syntax
5. **Testing Patterns**: Update test function syntax from Python `def test_*()` to JavaScript `test()` or `it()` functions
6. **Assertion Methods**: Replace Python `assert` statements with Jest assertion methods (`expect().toBe()`, `expect().toEqual()`, etc.)
7. **Error Handling**: Update exception handling examples from Python `ValueError` to JavaScript `Error` types
8. **Mocking Examples**: Replace Python `mocker` fixture examples with Jest `jest.mock()` and `jest.fn()` patterns
9. **Test Organization**: Update test file naming conventions from `test_*.py` to `*.test.js` or `*.spec.js`
10. **Package Management**: Include references to `package.json` and npm/yarn for dependency management
11. **TypeScript Support**: Include TypeScript examples where appropriate for type safety
12. **Next.js Integration**: Provide examples that work within Next.js project structure and conventions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Python Documentation**: The existing Python TDD documentation will remain unchanged
- **Other Testing Frameworks**: Focus exclusively on Jest; no coverage of Mocha, Vitest, or other alternatives
- **Advanced Jest Features**: Focus on core TDD patterns rather than advanced Jest configuration options
- **Build Tool Configuration**: Detailed webpack, Vite, or other build tool setup instructions
- **CI/CD Integration**: Specific continuous integration setup for JavaScript projects
- **Performance Testing**: Focus on unit testing rather than performance or integration testing

## Design Considerations

- **Consistency**: Maintain the same structure and flow as the original Python documentation
- **Readability**: Ensure JavaScript examples are clear and follow modern ES6+ conventions
- **Practicality**: Provide examples that work in real Next.js development environments
- **Accessibility**: Make the documentation easy for AI agents to parse and follow

## Technical Considerations

- **Jest Configuration**: Include basic Jest setup for Next.js projects
- **ES6 Modules**: Use modern JavaScript import/export syntax throughout
- **TypeScript Integration**: Provide TypeScript examples where they add value
- **Next.js Compatibility**: Ensure examples work within Next.js project structure
- **Testing Utilities**: Reference Jest utilities like `describe()`, `beforeEach()`, `afterEach()`
- **Mock Patterns**: Include common Jest mocking patterns for external dependencies

## Success Metrics

- **Complete Language Conversion**: All Python code examples successfully converted to JavaScript
- **Framework Alignment**: All testing framework references updated to Jest
- **Directory Structure**: Project structure examples reflect JavaScript/Next.js conventions
- **Functionality**: All provided code examples are syntactically correct and functional
- **Clarity**: Documentation maintains the same level of clarity and instruction quality as the original
- **AI Agent Usability**: The documentation provides clear, actionable steps for AI agents to follow TDD practices

## Open Questions

- Should the documentation include both JavaScript and TypeScript examples, or focus on one?
- Are there any specific Next.js testing patterns or conventions that should be highlighted?
- Should we include examples of testing React components, or focus on pure JavaScript functions?
- Are there any specific Jest plugins or configurations commonly used in Next.js projects that should be mentioned?

## Implementation Notes

- The user will provide the new JavaScript content manually
- The existing Python documentation should remain as a separate reference
- Focus on maintaining the same instructional quality and TDD methodology
- Ensure all examples are immediately usable in a Next.js development environment
